# Autobuild

[![Build & Release Project](https://github.com/Kiwifuit/autobuild/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Kiwifuit/autobuild/actions/workflows/release.yml)

This repository is just a test repository that uses Github Actions to automatically build and release artifacts

This project does nothing special other than to create a flexible Github Actions workflow that I can use for a `cargo generate`

This repository only exists because I want to automate the build process for my executable binaries. If you want to check out the releases, go do so [here](https://github.com/Kiwifuit/autobuild/releases/latest). Do be warned it does absolutely nothing
